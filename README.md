# Blazin Pizza CO.

This Pizza Store app is the third project that I've created for my portfolio. It allows the user to make up an order which gradually shows up in the basket pane with each item the user clicks being displayed as soon as he clicks it or finishes topping up a pizza. It gives an interactive app-like experience to the user. Although the user can make an order without signing in to the website, if he does, he will be granted 20% of the money he spends as Blazin points. Upon reaching a 100 points or more, they can claim a medium pizza with up to 6 toppings for free.

I have made use of programming techniques such as Async, Generics, Polymorphism, (EF) Code-first, SOLID, and utilized technologies such as C#, ASP.NET MVC 5, SQL Server 2016, Entity Framework 6, Bootstrap 4, HTML, CSS and jQuery.
